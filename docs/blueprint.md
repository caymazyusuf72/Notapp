# **App Name**: Kinetic Notes

## Core Features:

- Note Display: Display notes in a grid or list view with title, content preview, and timestamp.
- Note Editor: Allow users to create, edit, and delete notes with a rich text editor and color picker.
- Animated Transitions: Enable smooth transition animations for page and modal appearances/disappearances.
- Image Attachment: Implement drag and drop image attachment. Include optional drag-and-drop and zoom preview feature for images.
- Note Search & Filtering: Provide search and filtering options to easily find notes by date, color, or favorite status.
- Local Storage: Store notes locally using IndexedDB or localStorage for persistent data storage.
- AI Content Highlighting: Use an LLM to decide whether the content of a note seems especially creative, or mundane; then use the outcome of the tool to emphasize/de-emphasize the visual styling of the note to the user

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light, desaturated blue (#A0B4D6) to provide a calm, reliable feel.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5) for light mode and dark gray (#333333) for dark mode to create contrast with notes.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#D0BCFF) for interactive elements.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a modern, neutral, readable style, especially good for longer text.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, for a computerized, techy, scientific feel in the headings.
- Use simple, modern icons from a library like Feather or Lucide.
- Use subtle animations with Framer Motion for hover effects, transitions, and gestures.
- Cards and modal windows should have rounded corners and smooth shadow animations on hover and click.
